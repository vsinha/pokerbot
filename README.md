Poker bot written in 5 hrs for the Enova hackathon at Purdue University (2013)

Written by myself and my team member Thomas Kilbride, using a hand evaluator from here https://github.com/aliang/pokerhand-eval

Much thanks to aliang for his hand evaluator.


Sadly, we did not place in the top three, although this bot (under the name 'skynet') was in first place for a large portion of the game.

All in all, the hackathon was super fun and I had a great time
